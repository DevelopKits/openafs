=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pts sleep> command can be used to cause a delay
of the indicated number of seconds.
This is mainly used with B<pts source> or B<pts interactive>
commands to insert a programmed delay between other commands.
This is useful when performing many operations that do not
need to be completed in a particularly timely fashion,
to give users with more timely needs better service.

B<pts> options:

Indicate the number of seconds to dawdle, before proceeding.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. Do not combine this flag with the 
B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see L<pts(1)>.

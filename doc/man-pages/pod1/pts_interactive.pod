</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pts interactive> command allows the user to enter an interactive
mode, useful for running bulk commands like creating new users or groups.

B<pts interactive> uses the authentication state supplied on its command
line to run all bulk commands. However, if a bulk command is supplied 
with authentication options such as B<-cell>, B<-localauth>, B<-auth> 
or B<-noauth> then it, and all subsequent bulk commands, will be run with
those options.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Prior to OpenAFS 1.4.5 and OpenAFS 1.5.23, the B<pts interactive> command
was only available on Unix or Linux and when OpenAFS was compiled with the
supergroups option (disabled by default).  As of OpenAFS 1.4.5 and 1.5.23,
it is always available.

Running bulk B<pts> commands may degrade the performance of the Protection
Server while they are run and server resources may not be released
immediately after commands are run. The B<pts sleep> command can be used
in interactive mode or with B<pts source> to give the Protection Server a
change to catch up.
